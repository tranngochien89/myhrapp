# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a Next.js application with Firebase authentication. The application will include a login screen, a registration screen, and protected routes.

## Plan

1.  **Create a `blueprint.md` file:** I'll start by creating a `blueprint.md` file to outline the plan.
2.  **Create a login page:** I'll create a new route at `/login` with a form for email and password.
3.  **Create a registration page:** I'll create a new route at `/register` with a form for email and password.
4.  **Create a `/lib/firebase.ts` file:** This will instantiate and export the Firebase app.
5.  **Create a `/lib/hooks.ts` file:** This will have a `useAuth` hook to determine if a user is logged in.
6.  **Create an `AuthContextProvider`:** This will wrap the root layout to provide authentication context to the app.
7.  **Create `/app/actions.ts`:** This will handle the server-side logic for login and registration.
8.  **Update the root layout:** I'll add a header with login, and register links.
9.  **Update the home page:** I'll remove the default content and replace it with a welcome message.
10. **Add Firebase to `mcp.json`:** I will add the Firebase server configuration to `.idx/mcp.json`.
11. **Install Firebase:** I'll install the necessary Firebase packages.
12. **Create the UI for the login page:** I'll create a visually appealing login page with email and password fields, and a submit button.
13. **Create the UI for the registration page:** I'll create a visually appealing registration page with email and password fields, and a submit button.
14. **Implement the login logic:** I'll use Firebase Authentication to handle user login.
15. **Implement the registration logic:** I'll use Firebase Authentication to handle user registration.
16. **Protect routes:** I'll use the `useAuth` hook to protect routes that require authentication.
17. **Add error handling:** I'll add error handling to the login and registration forms.
18. **Add loading states:** I'll add loading states to the login and registration forms.
19. **Style the login page:** I'll style the login page to be visually appealing.
20. **Style the registration page:** I'll style the registration page to be visually appealing.
21. **Lint and fix:** I'll run `npm run lint -- --fix` to ensure the code is clean.
22. **Final check:** I'll review the changes and make sure everything is working as expected.
